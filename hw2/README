To run, first build using `make clean && make` then run the following command
with your desired file, resolution, and shading mode (0 for Gouraud, 1 for
Phong) and pipe the output to put into a ppm file as below:

`./shaded [scene_desc.txt] [xres] [yres] [mode] > [scene.ppm]`

I've also made a bash script `generate_images.sh` that will compile the program
and create images in both shading methods for each scene file in the `data/` folder.
