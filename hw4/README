Separated part1 and part2 into two different programs

To run part1:
- Run the command `cd part1 && make all`
- To use, run `./glslRenderer [path/to/scene_file.txt] [xres] [yres] [shading_type]`
- - With `shading_type` = 0 using Gouraud shading, else using Phong shading

To run part2:
- Run the command `cd part2 && make all`
- To use, run `./glslRenderer [path/to/colorMap.png] [path/to/normalMap.png]`

Note that both of these programs were made on Apple Silicon so may have
to adjust the Makefiles for other platforms
