This Makefile is for MAC OS ARM
To run use the following command on the make directory:

make && ./renderer [path/to/scene_description.txt] [xres] [yres]

While running, you can press WASD to move around in the scene, press t to switch
to wireframe mode, and q to quit.

To use the arcball, click the left mouse button and move the model around.

For testing, I attached one scene file, the data/scene_bunny1.txt file
